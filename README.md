# 1 Taking input in Python
In Python, we use the input() function to ask the user for input. As a parameter, we input the text we want to display to the user. Once the user presses “enter,” the input value is returned.


# 2 Taking input from console in Python
There is a built-in function in Python called 
“input()” that lets users enter data from the console. The string parameter that is passed to the input() function is used to ask the user for input


# 3 Taking multiple inputs from user in Python
With the help of the split () function, developers can easily collect multiple inputs in Python from the user and assign all the inputs to the respective variables. Developers can specify a character that will be used as a separator to break the input provided by the user.


# 4 Python | Output using print() function
The print() function prints the specified message to the screen, or other standard output device. The message can be a string, or any other object, the object will be converted into a string before written to the screen.


# 5 How to print without newline in Python?
To print without a new line, set the 'end' to a blank string. The Python program below demonstrates how you can use 'end' to print without a new line.
print("Hello, world!", end="") 
print(" This is a single line. ")


# 6 Python end parameter in print()
The end parameter in the print function is used to add any string. At the end of the output of the print statement in python. The print function ends with a newline. (end=' ') It indicates that the end character has to be identified by whitespace and not a newline.


# 7 Python | sep parameter in print()
The sep parameter allows to specify a string that is used to separate the items being printed by the print() function. By default, the sep parameter is set to a single space character.


# 8 Python | Output Formatting
Formatting and output refer to presenting the output of a program. We can format the output or write the data into a file and some other specified form. Sometimes we need to control the coming output so we can format it according to our requirements.
